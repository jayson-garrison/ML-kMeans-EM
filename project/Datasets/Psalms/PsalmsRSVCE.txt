 Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the grasp of the unjust and cruel man. 
 For thou, O Lord, art my hope, my trust, O LORD, from my youth. 
 Upon thee I have leaned from my birth; thou art he who took me from my mother's womb. My praise is continually of thee. 
 I have been as a portent to many; but thou art my strong refuge. 
 My mouth is filled with thy praise, and with thy glory all the day. 
 Do not cast me off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength is spent. 
 For my enemies speak concerning me, those who watch for my life consult together, 
 and say, "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him." 
 O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste to help me! 
 May my accusers be put to shame and consumed; with scorn and disgrace may they be covered who seek my hurt. 
 But I will hope continually, and will praise thee yet more and more. 
 My mouth will tell of thy righteous acts, of thy deeds of salvation all the day, for their number is past my knowledge. 
 With the mighty deeds of the Lord GOD I will come, I will praise thy righteousness, thine alone. 
 O God, from my youth thou hast taught me, and I still proclaim thy wondrous deeds. 
 So even to old age and gray hairs, O God, do not forsake me, till I proclaim thy might to all the generations to come. * Thy power 
 and thy righteousness, O God, reach the high heavens. Thou who hast done great things, O God, who is like thee? 
 Thou who hast made me see many sore troubles wilt revive me again; from the depths of the earth thou wilt bring me up again. 
 Thou wilt increase my honor, and comfort me again. 
 In thee, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame! 
 In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me; incline thy ear to me, and save me! 
 Be thou to me a rock of refuge, a strong fortress, * to save me, for thou art my rock and my fortress.

 Fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries round about. 
 His lightnings lighten the world; the earth sees and trembles. 
 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. 
 The heavens proclaim his righteousness; and all the peoples behold his glory. 
 All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; all gods bow down before him. 
 Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of thy judgments, O God. 
 For thou, O LORD, art most high over all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods. 
 The LORD loves those who hate evil; * he preserves the lives of his saints; he delivers them from the hand of the wicked. 
 Light dawns* for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.

 Thou dost cause the grass to grow for the cattle, and plants for man to cultivate, * that he may bring forth food from the earth,

 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 
 His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron; 
 until what he had said came to pass the word of the LORD tested him. 
 The king sent and released him, the ruler of the peoples set him free; 
 he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions, 
 to instruct* his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom. 
 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
 And the LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes. 
 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. 
 He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. 
 They wrought his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham. 
 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled* against his words. 
 He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die. 
 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 
 O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples! 
 Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works!

 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually! 
 Remember the wonderful works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered, 
 O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones! 
 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 
 He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, 
 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, 
 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance." 
 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it, 
 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, 
 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account,

 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it, 
 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people, 
 he allowed no one to oppress them; he rebuked kings on their account, 
 saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, do my prophets no harm!" 
 When he summoned a famine on the land, and broke every staff of bread, 
 he had sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave. 
 His feet were hurt with fetters, his neck was put in a collar of iron; 
 until what he had said came to pass the word of the LORD tested him. 
 The king sent and released him, the ruler of the peoples set him free; 
 he made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his possessions, 
 to instruct* his princes at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom. 
 Then Israel came to Egypt; Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. 
 And the LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them stronger than their foes. 
 He turned their hearts to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants. 
 He sent Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen. 
 They wrought his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham. 
 He sent darkness, and made the land dark; they rebelled* against his words. 
 He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die. 
 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings. 
 He spoke, and there came swarms of flies, and gnats throughout their country. 
 He gave them hail for rain, and lightning that flashed through their land. 
 He smote their vines and fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country. 
 He spoke, and the locusts came, and young locusts without number; 
 which devoured all the vegetation in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground. 
 He smote all the first-born in their land, the first issue of all their strength. 
 Then he led forth Israel with silver and gold, and there was none among his tribes who stumbled. 
 Egypt was glad when they departed, for dread of them had fallen upon it. 
 He spread a cloud for a covering, and fire to give light by night. 
 They asked, and he brought quails, and gave them bread from heaven in abundance. 
 He opened the rock, and water gushed forth; it flowed through the desert like a river. 
 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant. 
 O give thanks to the LORD, call on his name, make known his deeds among the peoples! 
 Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works! 
 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice! 
 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his presence continually! 
 Remember the wonderful works that he has done, his miracles, and the judgments he uttered, 
 O offspring of Abraham his servant, sons of Jacob, his chosen ones! 
 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth. 
 He is mindful of his covenant for ever, of the word that he commanded, for a thousand generations, 
 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his sworn promise to Isaac, 
 which he confirmed to Jacob as a statute, to Israel as an everlasting covenant, 
 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your portion for an inheritance." 
 When they were few in number, of little account, and sojourners in it,

 Glory in his holy name; let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice!

 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD,

 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.

 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. 
 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 
 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea. 
 Praise the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever! 
 Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or show forth all his praise? 
 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! 
 Remember me, O LORD, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them; 
 that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage. 
 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High* at the Red Sea. 
 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power. 
 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 
 So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy. 
 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 
 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 
 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel.

 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea. 
 Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them. 
 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise. 
 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD. 
 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness, 
 and would disperse* their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands. 
 Then they attached themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead; 
 they provoked the LORD to anger with their doings, and a plague broke out among them. 
 Then Phinehas stood up and interposed, and the plague was stayed. 
 And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation for ever. 
 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account; 
 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash. 
 They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them, 
 but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did. 
 Praise the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever! 
 Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or show forth all his praise? 
 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! 
 Remember me, O LORD, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them; 
 that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage. 
 Both we and our fathers have sinned; we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. 
 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High* at the Red Sea. 
 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power. 
 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 
 So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy. 
 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 
 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 
 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. 
 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert; 
 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them. 
 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD, 
 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image. 
 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. 
 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,

 Our fathers, when they were in Egypt, did not consider thy wonderful works; they did not remember the abundance of thy steadfast love, but rebelled against the Most High* at the Red Sea. 
 Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his mighty power. 
 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it became dry; and he led them through the deep as through a desert. 
 So he saved them from the hand of the foe, and delivered them from the power of the enemy. 
 And the waters covered their adversaries; not one of them was left. 
 Then they believed his words; they sang his praise. 
 But they soon forgot his works; they did not wait for his counsel. 
 But they had a wanton craving in the wilderness, and put God to the test in the desert; 
 he gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them. 
 When men in the camp were jealous of Moses and Aaron, the holy one of the LORD, 
 the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. 
 Fire also broke out in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. 
 They made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a molten image. 
 They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. 
 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt, 
 wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea. 
 Therefore he said he would destroy them-- had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him, to turn away his wrath from destroying them. 
 Then they despised the pleasant land, having no faith in his promise. 
 They murmured in their tents, and did not obey the voice of the LORD. 
 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them that he would make them fall in the wilderness, 
 and would disperse* their descendants among the nations, scattering them over the lands. 
 Then they attached themselves to the Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead; 
 they provoked the LORD to anger with their doings, and a plague broke out among them. 
 Then Phinehas stood up and interposed, and the plague was stayed. 
 And that has been reckoned to him as righteousness from generation to generation for ever. 
 They angered him at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account; 
 for they made his spirit bitter, and he spoke words that were rash. 
 They did not destroy the peoples, as the LORD commanded them, 
 but they mingled with the nations and learned to do as they did. 
 They served their idols, which became a snare to them. 
 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons; 
 they poured out innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood. 
 Thus they became unclean by their acts, and played the harlot in their doings. 
 Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he abhorred his heritage; 
 he gave them into the hand of the nations, so that those who hated them ruled over them. 
 Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their power. 
 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious in their purposes, and were brought low through their iniquity. 
 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry. 
 He remembered for their sake his covenant, and relented according to the abundance of his steadfast love. 
 Praise the LORD! O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever! 
 Who can utter the mighty doings of the LORD, or show forth all his praise? 
 Blessed are they who observe justice, who do righteousness at all times! 
 Remember me, O LORD, when thou showest favor to thy people; help me when thou deliverest them; 
 that I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thy heritage.

 they saw the deeds of the LORD, his wondrous works in the deep. 
 For he commanded, and raised the stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea. 
 They mounted up to heaven, they went down to the depths; their courage melted away in their evil plight; 
 they reeled and staggered like drunken men, and were at their wits' end. 
 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress; 
 he made the storm be still, and the waves of the sea were hushed.

 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into thirsty ground, 
 a fruitful land into a salty waste, because of the wickedness of its inhabitants. 
 He turns a desert into pools of water, a parched land into springs of water. 
 And there he lets the hungry dwell, and they establish a city to live in; 
 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures for ever! 
 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he has redeemed from trouble

 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to a city to dwell in; 
 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them. 
 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men! 
 For he satisfies him who is thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things. 
 Some sat in darkness and in gloom, prisoners in affliction and in irons, 
 for they had rebelled against the words of God, and spurned the counsel of the Most High. 
 Their hearts were bowed down with hard labor; they fell down, with none to help. 
 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress; 
 he brought them out of darkness and gloom, and broke their bonds asunder. 
 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to the sons of men!

 Some were sick* through their sinful ways, and because of their iniquities suffered affliction; 
 they loathed any kind of food, and they drew near to the gates of death. 
 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress;

 This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept thy precepts. 
 The LORD is my portion; I promise to keep thy words. 
 I entreat thy favor with all my heart; be gracious to me according to thy promise.

 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy steadfast love; teach me thy statutes! 
 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according to thy word. 
 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in thy commandments. 
 Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now I keep thy word. 
 Thou art good and doest good; teach me thy statutes. 
 The godless besmear me with lies, but with my whole heart I keep thy precepts; 
 their heart is gross like fat, but I delight in thy law. 
 It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn thy statutes.

 How long must thy servant endure? When wilt thou judge those who persecute me? 
 Godless men have dug pitfalls for me, men who do not conform to thy law. 
 All thy commandments are sure; they persecute me with falsehood; help me! 
 They have almost made an end of me on earth; but I have not forsaken thy precepts. 
 In thy steadfast love spare my life, that I may keep the testimonies of thy mouth. 
 For ever, O LORD, thy word is firmly fixed in the heavens. 
 Thy faithfulness endures to all generations; thou hast established the earth, and it stands fast. 
 By thy appointment they stand this day; for all things are thy servants.

 If thou, O LORD, shouldst mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand? 
 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 
 I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, and in his word I hope; 
 my soul waits for the LORD more than watchmen for the morning, more than watchmen for the morning. 
 O Israel, hope in the LORD! For with the LORD there is steadfast love, and with him is plenteous redemption.

 Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan, 
 and gave their land as a heritage, a heritage to his people Israel. 
 Thy name, O LORD, endures for ever, thy renown, O LORD, throughout all ages. 
 For the LORD will vindicate his people, and have compassion on his servants. 
 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. 
 They have mouths, but they speak not, they have eyes, but they see not, 
 they have ears, but they hear not, nor is there any breath in their mouths. 
 Like them be those who make them!-- yea, every one who trusts in them! 
 O house of Israel, bless the LORD! O house of Aaron, bless the LORD! 
 O house of Levi, bless the LORD! You that fear the LORD, bless the LORD!

 Put not your trust in princes, in a son of man, in whom there is no help. 
 When his breath departs he returns to his earth; on that very day his plans perish. 
 Happy is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, 
 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them; who keeps faith for ever; 
 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free;

 the LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.
